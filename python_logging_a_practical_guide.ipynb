    "# Python logging: a practical guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Python logging isn't easy. When I was learning python, I made many attempts to use logging in my applications. Usually I would end up frustrated and thinking that setting everything up correctly wasn't worth the hassle. It's only when I started building larger applications and logging became a neccessity, that I finally figured out what was going on. Learning to use python logging is rather like learning to ride a bicycle. It's difficult  to start with, but once it clicks, it's something you'll never forget.\n",

The only parent of 'package' is the root logger and we know that this logger has a log level of WARNING by default. Therefore, the logger's effective level is 30. It's the effective level (not the logger.level attribute) that determines whether a log message gets passed to the handlers.\n",

That's a great question, and to understand, you need to know how naming is generally used in logging for large python applications.\n",

    "In my graph of \"logging hierarchy\" you might have noticed that I named the loggers \"package\" and \"module\".

This becomes very useful when you want to find out about the provenance of logging messages because formatters can include the name of the logger in the log message itself. Another advantage of naming loggers with the names of your modules and packages it prevents collisions with other loggers from other packages.\n",

    "When developing a library, it is recommended not to add handlers to your loggers. Instead, just let the LogRecords flow to the root logger and if the user of your library wants to do something with your logs, they can create the handler and formatters they want. Even better is to add a logging.NullHandler() to the base of your logging hierarchy (i.e getLogger('package')). That way, if the user of your library does not configure logging for their application, your messages won't be displayed by the lastResort handler. This is described in more detail in the official documentation on [configuring logging for a library](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging-for-a-library).\n",

    "1. Your application is a part in a larger multi process application:\n",
    "The best practice for logging within a large application is to only send messages to STDOUT (i.e only use StreamHandlers(stream=sys.stdout)). By doing that, you are essentially delegating the role of storing logs to your application's environment. Imagine if your application is one process in a larger multiprocess application with each sending its logs somewhere different. It would be a nightmare for the application environment to compile all the logs and analyse them together. If all processes send their logs to STDOUT, the environment knows where everything is and can decide what to do with the STDOUT stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your application is standalone\n",
    "If your application is standalone, and not being managed by some external process, then it's OK to be handling the output of your log yourself. In that case, you can configure logging for your application with a [configuration file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html) or directly in code as we have been doing so far."
